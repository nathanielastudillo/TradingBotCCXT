Simple arbitrage script for a fixed period.

The bots are for buying the 10 lowest volume pairs and holding for a determined time while checking whether the price has dropped 1% (at which time you cut your losses) or risen 2% (at which time you capitalize). 

This is dead ass simple as far as trading strategies go. I would suggest only using this as a starting point. It isn't a free money generator, and if you have even an inkling that that's what you're getting, please do more research into trading. In an uptrend, this might make you a tad more than just sitting on your funds. Please be careful. Losses are your own responsibility. Use at your own risk :)
